"""Feed page: structural patches pushed by the server.

Every second ``tick()`` ATTACHES a new line to the source — it reaches
the browser as an ``insert`` patch (the new fragment only, the sibling
elements never travel). Past five lines the oldest is dropped: a
``remove`` patch, just the id. The list grows and scrolls with no
client request and no replace of the container.
